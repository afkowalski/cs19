# CS19 Splinter Session Webpage Template

The Cambridge Workship on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems, and the Sun ("Cool Stars") 
has a strong tradition of supporting independently organized parallel sessions
throughout the course of the workshop ("splinter sessions"). Cool Stars 19 in 
Uppsala will not be an exception. To provide the best possible experience for 
attendees of the Workshop and individual splinter sessions, we require that 
splinter sessions compose a dedicated webpage with all pertinent information
about the session (date, motivation, speakers, schedule, etc). 

Making a webpage from scratch can take a lot of time, as we can attest. To help
relieve effort on our part and the part of individual splinter organizers, we use
the Foundation 5 front end and provide this template. An added benefit is that 
this allows us to homogenize the look and feel of events surrounding 
Cool Stars 19. Below is some basic information on [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/), 
information about where to host your splinter webpage, and instructions on what 
to change in the template, with highlights of a few particular features.  

### About Foundation 5

### Where to Host

Where to host your splinter webpage is up to you, but there are really only 
two options. First, you can host it on your institutes web server. Check with
your local IT department if you prefer this option. Second, we are happy to 
host your splinter session webpage on our server along with the core of the 
Cool Stars 19 webpage. 

We recommend the latter option for purposes of longevity. The Cool Stars 19 
web server will remain accessible for an indefinite period of time after the 
conference. Therefore, splinter session pages that we host and information will
be archived and preserved for future reference.
